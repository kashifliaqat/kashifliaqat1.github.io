I am currently working as a Lecturer (Mechanical Engineering) at [Balochistan University of IT, Engineering, and Management Sciences (BUITEMS)](https://www.buitms.edu.pk/), Pakistan. Where I am teaching courses at undergrad level and helping students with their senior year design projects.  

I completed my [Masters in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/me) from [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/) on [Fulbright Scholarship](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) in May 2021. At FSU, [Dr. Juan C. Ordonez](https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/me/people/ordonez-j) was my major advisor and I was part of his Thermal Management Group at [Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS)](https://www.caps.fsu.edu/). During my masters, I also served as a Graduate Intern (Thermal Optimization) at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) under the supervision of [Dr. Alexander Zolan](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/alexander-zolan.html). 

My areas of research interests and expertise are: Energy Systems, Renewable Energy, Heat Transfer, Thermal Modeling, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), Machine and Deep Learning, Data Analysis, and Thermal Optimization. 

In my free time, I like to play [Cricket](https://www.britannica.com/sports/cricket-sport), watch TV series, and play video games ([CSGO](https://blog.counter-strike.net/)). I love to spend my time looking at memes on the internet. Here's [one](https://github.com/kashifliaqat/kashifliaqat.github.io/blob/master/files/meme.jpg) related to Mechanical Engineering.
